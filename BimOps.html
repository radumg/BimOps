<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>DevOps</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The DevOps movement started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps"><span class="s2">in roughly 2008</span></a> and was designed to address the gap between the development of software (dev) and the operation/use of said software (ops).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jez Humble <a href="https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/"><span class="s2">explains</span></a> that DevOps is :</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand this was not only a technological gap, but more so a process, workflow and human operations gap.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The initiators identified inefficiencies, recurring problems and ultimately many opportunities for improvement in the space between development and operation. They understood that the closer the two seemingly disparate stages of a software product’s lifecycle are integrated, the quicker, leaner and simpler both sides become.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ultimately, their thinking and exploration led to a whole new branch of work, a whole new generation of tools and innovations such as continuous deployment or integration, as well as an unprecedented level of automation.</span></p>

<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>aka Better Information Management</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As most people operating in the field of BIM will tell you, it’s all about process and information management, not just 3D modelling as most newcomers to BIM will assume. This is very eloquently portrayed by Bond Bryan Digital’s redefinition of BIM as Better Information Management, see <a href="http://www.bondbryan.com/digital"><span class="s2">here</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BIM (as defied above) has the incredibly hard task to guide &amp; power a project for its entire lifecycle, starting from its very first steps as a brief through design, development, construction, then operation and finally starting the process all over again when maintenance, renovation or demolition are needed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Delivering a built asset is then a never-ending process with tens or hundreds of parties involved, </span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>BIM Level 2</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, the industry is working towards a set of standards for delivering a built asset digitally, including but not limited to :</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">collaboration</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">modelling standards (level of definition)</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">information exchanges</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">delivery timetables</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">handover procedures</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">etc</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">between different parties (architects, contractors, consultants, engineers, etc) and stages (brief, concept, design, construction, operation).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is known as BIM level 2 and there are <a href="https://www.thenbs.com/knowledge/bim-levels-explained"><span class="s2">many</span></a> <a href="http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/"><span class="s2">available</span></a> <a href="http://www.bre.co.uk/page.jsp?id=3447"><span class="s2">resources</span></a> <a href="http://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/BIM_level_2"><span class="s2">that</span></a> define what it is and explain how to achieve it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I personally see Level 2 as the precursor to BimOps : precursor because it has a narrower &amp; more focused scope and is tied to specific deliverables and UK operations, but more importantly because it is bringing together multi-disciplinary teams around the process &amp; data of delivering projects.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>BimOps</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This brings us to the whole reason of this post : BimOps.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I think simply emulating the DevOps semantic model, BimOps could be defined as the link between BIM and operation of a project. However, given the multifaceted nature of BIM, the multiple (neverending) stages and complexity of projects, BimOps would quite obviously need to be <i>the link between each stage of a project as well as the overarching process itself.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why mention it as a link between each stage ? Because BimOps does and should handle the transition between each stage of a project’s lifecycle.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Brief -&gt; Concept</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Concept -&gt; Design</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Design -&gt; Construction</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Construction -&gt; Operation (facility management)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">[diagrams to be added later]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Remember that DevOps definition ? Very much still applies here :</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>BimOps across industry</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mirroring DevOps history, the increasing use of BIM software and processes saw the advent of new positions within the industry: BIM managers, BIM coordinators , information managers etc.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">BimOps coalesces these roles in one movement and gives it a name.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The hope is that in doing so, we will hopefully provide a framework/space for new roles to develop, more clearly define their attributes and foster collaboration across roles, practices and countries.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Having a common space to operate in and collaborate will give these yet-undefined roles room to not only materialise, grow &amp; mature, but also open up to people whose expertise is invaluable but are currently operating just outside the BIM sphere due to technological (or other) barriers.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>BimOps in practice</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s quite clear that as design &amp; computational complexity of projects increases, the overlap between BIM operations and IT &amp; software development will continue to increase.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking at our DevOps cousins, we can learn a lot from their hard work and jump-start progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As first steps, we should strive to have more :</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Defined roles</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Automation</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Purpose-made tools</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Quantifiable metrics</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Get involved</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The above ideas and notes are meant to kick-start some much-needed discussions around roles, expertise, training, where we’re headed with BIM and who is leading that charge. <a href="https://tangiblebim.wordpress.com/2016/04/19/the-curse-of-the-bim-manager/"><span class="s2"><i>(hint : it should not be software vendors) </i></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They are not meant to be prescriptive, but rather descriptive, open to collaboration and further critical thinking.<i> (meaning i might be way off base here, but it’s also possible I stumbled on to something).</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To this end, i’ve published this on GitHub and Medium alike and ask people to openly comment, expand or do some course-correction if necessary.</span></p>
